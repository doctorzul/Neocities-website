            <h2>Welcome home!</h2>

            <p>Howdy! My name is <b>doctorZul</b>, and this is my tiny corner of the Internet!
            I'm a HUGE fan of these Indie Web websites that have been popping up, and I've
            been wanting to make my own for the longest time! Recently, I've started a class on
            Web Technologies in college where we learn to mess around with HTML, CSS, and JS,
            and it was the perfect little push I needed to make my own website on NeoCities.<br>
            (I'm still learning so please excuse any mess you might see around here! Here be dragons!)
            </p><p>Like I mentioned above, I'm doctorZul, though you can call me Zul! My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>. 
            I'm 21 years old, currently in college. Like any good nerd, I love video
            games like Minecraft, Deltarune, Portal, etc. I also love writing, so maybe you'll see some of my
            stuff here in the future!
            </p><p>
            As for this website, I mostly wanted it to be an exercise in how to, ya'know, MAKE a website.
            I don't really have any grand plans for it, but I do want to make it a place where I can share
            my thoughts, like a digital common-place book! I might also share stuff I enjoy, like music,
            games, art, etc. We'll see how it goes!
            </p><p>
            The look of this website is probably going to change A LOT as I learn more about web design
            and get better at making stuff look cool. As of now, this place is pretty barebones. Feel free
            to stick around or check back later to see how it evolves! If you have any tips or have any questions,
            feel free to reach out to me (once I figure out how to do that, lmao.)
            </p><p>
            Not much more to say for now, but thanks for stopping by! I'll leave you with some other NeoCities
            sites that really inpired me to make my own:
            </p>

            Pretty empty... I'll add more when I have time to explore more websites!

            <h2>Manifesto: Must this too pass?</h2>

            <p>Nothing in this world is permanent, and that's a terrible thing. But it's also a great thing!
            I love (like most people) to feel sorry for myself when I'm down in the dumps. I do. But I also
            love to remind myself that this too shall pass. No bad moment is eternal. Of course, that also
            means that no good moment is eternal, either. So, in order to tip the scales in my favor a little
            (and because it's good practice and I love it...!), I'm undergoing an effort to catalogue the things
            that make me happy. The good, the funny, the stupid, the weird, the works. This is that!
            Thanks for stopping by.
            </p>
